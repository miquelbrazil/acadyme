# Acadyme

Acadyme is a custom, web-based learning platform my partner and I are building for our two kids.

We've decided to approach this project with the [#BuildInPublic](https://x.com/buildinpublic) mindset and so this `README.md` will contain our initial feature ideas and design concepts as we begin to futher develop the project.

## Project Name

We've been going back and forth between naming the project some variation of Academy (academe) or Smarter (smartur).

## Original Notes from Obsidian

@todo: migrate these notes into the main text.

Calendar Puzzles
- spell the day of the week
- what day of the week is it
- relative time questions
- what is Today
- What is Tomorrow
- Moving Yesterday?
- Game where you can slide relative time and then you can see how it changes the day reference
- put day of week tiles in order
- offer 3 tries to get a question correct
- always show the answer and A/B between why the answer is correct or why their answer is incorrect
- add an option to restock particular items at the beginning of every week such as the ability to Get Code Free day

This first part will be The Time Learning Pack

Build a system for designing new expansions to the learning, people can either generate new Learning Packs by selecting configuration or other developers with kids can use a API/DSL for designing their own Learning Packs. Offers the chance to learn how to build documentation site. This part of the project should really focus on developer happiness in using the platform.

Can there be a feature to take a picture of the child and create an AI generated avatar for them as part of the onboarding process. Will need to learn how to use “getUserMedia” in JavaScript.
If you want to use a skip, you have to log in and use it from your “backpack”. Your backpack can contain all sorts of items and can also where we integrate their “bank account”.

Puzzles can be part of learning Domains that can be created as configuration

Temporal
Numerical
Sequential
Application
Identification

There would also be Question Formats
Fill in the blank
Spellling
Matching
Recall
Reasoning

Get a Wyze lock box or something where codes can be set through an API.

The remote can be put in the box each day and then they have to get the code for the device, devices or the bank. Can we get and program 3 remotes one for each and one for both. Determine if we can get codes to access content or devices. If they want to do something together than they have to each solve a puzzle.

They can earn badges that show progress and can earn monetary, gift cards and chances to skip questions, get a hint for a question (sometimes the hint will be to eliminate what the answer IS NOT to teach deductive reasoning)

Prizes can be won in as a team or invisibly.

Setup PIN numbers so they can start learning how to remember sequences and add a shape and color as part of 2FA exposure.

How can you make Unlocker more portable?

I want design to be heavy outlined sticker illustrations

Looking for a bubbly or marker bold display font and something sans serif for reading text.

Pair clickable items with audio so promote associating site with sound. Lets us setup audio studio equipment and can be recorded as daddy or manny narrator.

We can create our own audio stories with images created from AI and display as a choose your own adventure style story.

The choose your own adventure stories can also include games like finding items or solving puzzles in order to move on through it. Simple game design.

How can I open source this project?
